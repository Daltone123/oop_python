## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in Python
This repository serves as a learning resource for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Each Python script illustrates a specific OOP concept, allowing learners to grasp fundamental principles effectively.

## 1. Inheritance
Description: Demonstrates how classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes.
File: inheritance.py
Objective: Learn how to create parent and child classes, and how inheritance promotes code reusability.
## 2. Encapsulation
Description: Shows how to encapsulate data within a class and control access to it.
File: encapsulation.py
Objective: Understand the concept of data hiding and how to use getters and setters to access and modify data.
## 3. Polymorphism
Description: Illustrates how objects can take on multiple forms and exhibit different behaviors.
File: polymorphism.py
Objective: Learn how to implement polymorphism using method overriding and method overloading.
## 4. Abstraction
Description: Introduces the concept of abstraction, focusing on hiding implementation details.
File: abstraction.py
Objective: Understand how to create abstract classes and methods to define a blueprint for other classes.
